# Javascript 
# API consumption and Functional programming

## Description

I created a weather app that shows the current climate and forcasts for 
the following four days in Reykjavík.
In this weather app I joined two projects into one, the API consumption 
and functional programming
The API is fetched from Veðurstofa Íslands, The site is redirected through 
a proxy due to CORS restrictions. The application contains examples of:

- Fetch API
- Async-Await
- then-catch-finally
- Promises
- Pure functions
- Higher Order Functions
- Array methods .find(), .filter(), .forEach() and .map()

Not mobile friendly!
